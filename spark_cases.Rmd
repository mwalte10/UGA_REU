```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This document aims to identify patterns/trends in the spark cases within each county. The protocol will be as follows:

* Create a matrix (**insert name**) including the first cases within each county as well as the cases the proceed in the following month. 
* Identify those which are in the same district.
* Look for any similarities in age patterns at the beginning of an outbreak. 
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
